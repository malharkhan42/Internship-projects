Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

Objective
The objective of this task is to learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset in order to understand data trends, distributions, and relationships between features using basic exploratory data analysis techniques.

Dataset Used:
We used the "Iris dataset", which contains measurements of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species. The dataset was loaded using pandas (via seaborn’s built-in dataset loader).

Key Results and Findings
> We observed that the dataset is clean, well-structured, and contains no missing values.
> Summary statistics helped us understand the range and variation of each feature.
> Scatter plots showed strong relationships between petal length and petal width, with clear separation between species.
> Histograms revealed distinct distribution patterns, especially for petal-related features.
> Box plots helped identify potential outliers, mainly in sepal width.
> Petal-based features were found to be the most informative for distinguishing between flower species.

This project demonstrates the importance of exploratory data analysis and visualization before applying any machine learning models.
